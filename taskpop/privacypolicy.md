# TaskPop Privacy Policy

**Publication Date:** December 1, 2025
**Effective Date:** December 1, 2025
**Last Modified:** December 1, 2025

## 1. Privacy Policy Statement

This privacy policy applies to the **TaskPop** application (referred to as "the App"), which is developed and operated by **WhaleChild LLC** (referred to as "we" or "**TaskPop**").

The App is designed to help you record and manage personal goals directly on your device. We are committed to strict data privacy. **TaskPop is an offline-first application that does not require registration. We do not operate our own servers to store your goal data, and we do not include any third-party tracking SDKs.**

## 2. How We Handle Data

### 2.1 Core Data (Goals and Tasks)
All data you generate in the App (such as to-do lists and goal records) is stored exclusively in two places:
1.  **Local Storage:** Sandbox storage on your iOS device.
2.  **iCloud Private Database:** If you enable iCloud, your data syncs via your personal Apple iCloud account.

**We (WhaleChild LLC) cannot access, view, or modify your goal data.** It is encrypted and managed by Apple.

### 2.2 Data Collection and Minimization
We adhere to a strict "No Data Collection" policy regarding your usage of the App:
* **No Third-Party Analytics:** We do not use third-party analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase, Mixpanel).
* **No Ad Tracking:** We do not display ads and do not collect identifiers for advertising (IDFA).
* **No Crash Reporting SDKs:** We do not use third-party crash reporting tools that collect logs.

*Note: Apple may collect anonymous diagnostic data or crash logs at the system level if you have opted-in to "Share iPhone Analytics" in your iOS settings. This data is aggregated by Apple and does not identify you personally.*

### 2.3 Customer Support Communications
While the App itself does not collect your email address, you may choose to contact us for support via email.
* **If you email us:** We will use your email address solely to reply to your inquiry.
* **Retention:** We do not store your email address in any marketing database. Once the support issue is resolved, relevant correspondence is not permanently retained for business analysis.

## 3. Data Security and Permissions

### 3.1 Apple iCloud
Since the App uses iCloud for synchronization, the security of your data in the cloud is governed by Apple's robust security measures. All data transfers between your device and iCloud are encrypted.

### 3.2 In-App Purchases
We use Apple's native **StoreKit** for in-app purchases.
* Payment transactions are processed directly by the Apple App Store.
* We do not have access to your credit card information or billing details.
* We only receive an anonymous receipt token to validate your Pro status.

## 4. California Privacy Rights (CCPA/CPRA)

For users residing in the United States, including California:
* **We do not sell your personal information.**
* Since we do not collect personal data (like names, addresses, or device usage profiles), there is no data to request for deletion or portability from our servers.
* You have full control over your data by deleting the App or managing your iCloud storage.

## 5. Data Deletion

You retain full ownership of your data. You can delete your data at any time by:
1.  **Deleting Local Data:** Uninstalling the App will remove all local files.
2.  **Deleting Cloud Data:** Go to iOS Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud > Manage Account Storage > TaskPop > "Delete Data from iCloud".

## 6. Updates to the Privacy Policy

We may update this policy to reflect changes in laws or App features. We will notify you of significant changes via App Store release notes or our official website. Continued use of the App implies acceptance of the updated policy.
